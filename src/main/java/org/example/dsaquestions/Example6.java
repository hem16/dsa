//You are given an integer array numbers. In one operation, you can
// replace any element in nums with any integer.
// numbers is considered continous if both of the following conditions are fulfilled:
// All elements in nums are unique.

//The difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in nums equals
// nums.length -1
//Ex : nums = [4,2,5,3] is continous, but nums = [1,2,3,5,6] is not continous.
//Return the minimun number of operations to make nums continous.
